## Project goals

This is the first small personal project built with ReactJS. My goal was to put most of the material that I've learned to practice.

## App description

This app uses free external API to fetch the data. It is a very simple app where you can type in a drink name and it will show you the results. You can then click on any of the results and get a modal opened with more detailed infomation. The site is mobile friendly.
